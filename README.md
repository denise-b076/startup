[My Notes](notes.md)

Tint-Hint is a pallette generator that can randomly generate colors and save them to a user's gallery to be shared along with other recent users' palletes.


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology
- [x] One or more rough sketches of your application. Images must be embedded in this file using Markdown image references.

### Elevator pitch

Have you ever made a solid design for your webpage or artwork, but you have no idea where to start in terms of a color palette? Tint-Hint is an application that allows you to simply pull out your device and click a button to generate a random color pallete. If there are some colors you like and not others, you can lock some of the hues and reroll others. Once you have a color palette you are satisfied with, you can give it a name and save it in your gallery to access whenever you want. You can even gain inspiration from the palettes that other recent users create.

### Design

![Design image](web_design.png)

Below is a sequence diagram showing how people interact with the backend when creating palettes.

```mermaid

    actor Tom
    actor Brady
    Tom->>Server: "Game Day" palette
    Server -->>Brady: "Game Day" palette
    Brady->>Server: "Cottagecore" palette
    Server -->>Tom: "Cottagecore" palette

```

### Key features

- Secure login over HTTPS
- Ability to randomly generate palettes with 4 colors
- Display appearance and hexadecimal color codes of generated colors
- Ability to lock colors from being rerolled
- Save palettes under user-generated title
- Store user-created palettes in gallery along with date created
- Palettes created by most recent users displayed in 'Inspire' tab

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for application. Four HTML pages. Login page, palette generation page, gallery page, and recent user-created palette page.
- **CSS** - Application styling that looks good on different screen sizes, uses good whitespace, color choice and contrast.
- **React** - Provides login, display of palette, generating new palette, locking colors in palette, giving title to palette, display of other users palettes, and use of React for routing and components.
- **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
    - login
    - saving palette
    - retrieving palettes, names, and dates
    - retrieving palettes created by other users
    - displaying an artwork on the login page using the https://api.artic.edu/docs/ service
- **DB/Login** - Store users, palettes, palette names, and date created in database. Register and login users. Credentials securely stored in database. Can't save palettes unless authenticated.
- **WebSocket** - As users save palettes, they are displayed to other users in recent user-created palette page.

## ðŸš€ React part 1: Routing deliverable

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **Bundled using Vite** - done!
- [x] **Components** - Login, palette maker, gallery table, and inspire table are all components with mocks for login, generating colors, gallery, inspire, and WebSocket.
    - [x] **login** - When you press the login or create button it takes you to the palette maker page.
    - [x] **palette maker** - When you press the save palette button it takes you to the gallery page. In the final application, this will save a palette in the gallery database and in the table.
    - [x] **gallery** - When you press the name of a palette in the table, it takes you to the palette maker page. In the final application, this will fill the palette with the colors saved to the database
    - [x] **inspire** - When you press the name of a user generated palette, it will take you to the palette maker page. In the final application, this will fill the palette with the colors saved by another user in the database.
    - [x] **WebSocket** - I filled the inspire table with example palettes. In the final application, these palettes will be filled with WebSocket data.
- [x] **Router** - Routing between login, palette maker, gallery, and inspire components

## ðŸš€ React part 2: Reactivity

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] **All functionality implemented or mocked out** - All of what I described in part one has been implemented. Now, once you put in a login, you can go to any of the other three pages. The palette maker generates colors, and will save them to the gallery page with a given palette name. Clicking this name will bring up the colors and hex codes the way they were saved. The Inspire tab mocks out Websocket by randomly generating palettes every 7 seconds and showing them. The names of these palettes can also be clicked to bring up the colors and hexcodes in the palette maker.
- [x] **Hooks** - I use the `useState` and `useEffect` hooks throughout my code, such as setting up the changes to palettes and colors, and rerendering pages according to those changes when specified in the code.
